# FAKE POSTS

### This web app, was created to simulate the action of create and see posts.
All this, only using:
- React
- Javascript
- React Hooks
    - useContext
    - useState
    - useEffect

With this base, we can create a Backend to manage the posts creation.
Also, we could read those posts with that backend, creating a Full CRUD.
